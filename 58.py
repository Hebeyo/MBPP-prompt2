"""Complete the function with better-performing Python code. Use efficient function calls and looping structures, use efficient algorithms, avoid unnecessary complexity and waste of resources, ensure that the code is concise, and make full use of language features."""
"""Pay attention to integrating programming language features, use efficient built-in modules of the programming language, avoid poor exception handling, and reduce unused local variables."""

'''Write a python function to check whether the given two integers have opposite sign or not.
'''

def opposite_Signs(x,y): 
    return (x < 0) ^ (y < 0);

'''
Standard answer: 
def opposite_Signs(x,y): 
    return ((x ^ y) < 0); 
'''
assert opposite_Signs(1,-2) == True
assert opposite_Signs(3,2) == False
assert opposite_Signs(-10,-10) == False
