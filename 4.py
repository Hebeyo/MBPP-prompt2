"""Complete the function with better-performing Python code. Use efficient function calls and looping structures, use efficient algorithms, avoid unnecessary complexity and waste of resources, ensure that the code is concise, and make full use of language features."""
"""Be mindful to choose better-performing function interfaces when calling functions, avoiding unnecessary deep recursion."""

'''Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
'''

import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums

'''
Standard answer:

  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
